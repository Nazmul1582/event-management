## Answer of MCQ Questions

1. answer => ` A: {} `
- *description:* As `greetign` is not declared, it's directly initialized without let or const. So, It will be a global variable and it can be access from any where of code. As a result, `greetign` will be a global variable and it can be accessible. So, the answer is `{}`.


2. answer-2     => ` C: "12" `
- *description:* The sum function take two parameters and return their addition. Here, it gives two arguments. first one is number(1) and second one is string(2). As the addition of number and string are concate both, So `1 + "2" = "12"`. 1 and "2" will concatinate together. 

3. answer-3     => ` A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'] `
- *description:* As the `food` array don't changed, The result will be A. Here `info` object has used `food` array's element and changed it. As a result, `info` object has changed but `food` array is not changed 

4. answer-4     => ` B: Hi there, undefined `
- *description:* Here `sayHi` function take a parameter. but when it invocked, it doesn't get any value as argument. So, the value of name parameter will `undefined`. So, this function will return `Hi there, undefined`

5. answer-5     => ` C: 3 `
- *description:* Here in `forEach` method, it will addition `count` variable's value with `1` if `num === true`. In this loop, first time `num` is `0`, So it can not enter if block. then second time `num` is `1`, So it will enter if block and add `count` (which value is `0`) and `1` equal `1`. then third time `num` is `2`, So it will enter if block and add `count` (which value is now `1`) and `1` equal `2`. then fourth time `num` is `3`, So it will enter if block and add `count` (which value is now `2`) and `1` equal `3`. then loop will be finished. As a result, The answer will `C: 3`
